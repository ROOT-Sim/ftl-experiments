Accepted to ACM SIGSIM PADS 2024

## Authors & Contacts

* Romolo Marotta <romolo.marotta@gmail.com>
* Alessandro Pellegrini <a.pellegrini@ing.uniroma2.it>
* Philipp Andelfinger <philipp.andelfinger@uni-rostock.de>

## Requirements

* x86_64 CPU and CUDA capable GPU
* 32GB of RAM
* Unix system with gcc/g++/cuda toolchain
* The compilation should be performed on the target machine due to compile-time code generation phases
* Root priviledges for gathering stats from performance counters

The hardware/software configuration used by the authors is:

* CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 7950x
* RAM: 64GB
* GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti
* OS: Debian GNU/Linux 11


## Dependencies

* For running tests: ```bash, gcc, g++, cmake, make, cuda, python3, perf```
* For processing data and generating figures: ```bash, python3, pip3, pandas, gnuplot, fonts-linuxlibertine```
* For generating RCR report: ```pdflatex, lscpu, lsmem, lspci```

Having CUDA toolkit and drivers working with distribution packages might not be trivial.
We added two scripts that allows to install all the dependencies for Ubuntu 23.10:

1. Move to the artifact folder: ```cd FTL```
2. download CUDA: ```./download_cuda_12_5.sh```
3. install all dependencies: ```./deps.sh```

For other distributions please follows the instructions available at:
* https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64

## Kick the tires instructions

1. Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/ROOT-Sim/ftl-experiments.git FTL```
2. Move to the artifact folder: ```cd FTL```
3. Ensure that nvcc compiler is found by cmake (see Common Issues)
4. Ensure that perf can monitor performance counters (see Common Issues)
5. Build: ```./exp.sh build```
6. Run a small simulation ```./exp.sh kick```

## Article claims

The article has three major claims:

* C1: the balanced configuration favours GPU PDES implementation
* C2: the unbalanced configuration favours CPU PDES implementation
* C3: the follow-the-leader approach can reduce the execution time of simulations with time-varying computational
intensity 

## Reproducing the results

The paper has 12 Figures that can be reproduced.
These can be generated by running 3 experiments.
The mapping between claims, experiments, figures and tables are resumed in the following table.

| Claim | Figures            | Experiment   |
|-------|--------------------|--------------|
| C1    | 2a, 2d, 2g, 3a     | balanced     |
| C2    | 2b, 2e, 2h, 3b     | unbalanced   |
| C3    | 2c, 2f, 2i, 3c     | alternating  |

To setup the environment:
1. ```cd FTL```
2. ```./exp.sh build```

To run an experiment <exp> and process its results, type the following:

3. ```nohup ./exp.sh run_<exp> &```
4. ```./exp.sh plot_<exp>```

To run all experiments and process their results at once, type the following:

3. ```nohup ./exp.sh run_all &```
4. ```./exp.sh all```

The expected runtime of each experiment is detailed in the following table:

| Experiment   | Runtime |
|--------------|---------|
| balanced     | 10m     |
| unbalanced   | 10m     |
| alternating  | 10m     |
| **Total**    | **30m** |


Once all experiments have been run, you can find each figure at:

| Figure       | Path |
|--------------|---------|
| 2a           | run_logs/balanced/1.processed.pdf     |
| 2b           | run_logs/unbalanced/1.processed.pdf     |
| 2c           | run_logs/alternating/1.processed.pdf     |
| 2d           | run_logs/balanced/2.processed.pdf     |
| 2e           | run_logs/unbalanced/2.processed.pdf     |
| 2f           | run_logs/alternating/2.processed.pdf     |
| 2g           | run_logs/balanced/3.processed.pdf     |
| 2h           | run_logs/unbalanced/3.processed.pdf     |
| 2i           | run_logs/alternating/3.processed.pdf     |
| 3a           | run_logs/balanced.energy.pdf     |
| 3b           | run_logs/unbalanced.energy.pdf     |
| 3c           | run_logs/alternating.energy.pdf     |

To generate a report with both original and reproduced figures:

5. ```pdflatex report.tex```


## Notes
All scripts have been tested by running them from the following path:

  ```FTL/```

## Common issues

* Installing CUDA 12
  * follow the instructions available at https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64
  * ensure that cmake finds CUDA by:
     * either adding ```/usr/local/cuda/bin``` to the ```PATH``` variable
     * or add ```set(CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER /usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc)``` to the ```rootsim_gputw/CMakeLists.txt``` file and run again ```./exp.sh build```
* Installing perf
  * ```sudo apt install linux-tools-$(uname -r)```
  * allows any process to gather perf stats: ```echo -1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid```
